# U2.W4: Homework Cheater!


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: Arguments from the user
# Output: A finished template containing information
# Steps: 


# 3. Initial Solution
def template(title,date,thesis)
	 "The title of this paper is #{title}. It happened on #{date}. I believe that #{thesis}."
end



# 4. Refactored Solution

def template(title,date,thesis)
	 "The title of this paper is #{title}. It happened on #{date}. I believe that #{thesis}."
end







# 1. DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE


puts template("igloo", "today", "igloos are cool")=="The title of this paper is igloo. It happened on today. I believe that igloos are cool."



# 5. Reflection 

# This turned out to be easier than I thought it would be.  But first I had to learn what a mad lib was.  After that, it was 
# pretty simple.
